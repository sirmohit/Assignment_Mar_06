    "    Range (Difference between Maximum and Minimum Values):\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculation: The range is calculated by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in a dataset.\n",
    "    Usage: The range provides a simple measure of variability by indicating the spread or extent of values in a dataset.\n",
    "        However, it is sensitive to extreme values or outliers, making it less reliable for datasets with extreme values.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculation: The variance is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each value and the mean of the dataset.\n",
    "    Usage: The variance provides a measure of variability by quantifying the average deviation of values from the mean.\n",
    "        It considers all values in the dataset but emphasizes extreme values or outliers due to the squaring process.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    Standard Deviation:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Calculation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average deviation\n",
    "        of values from the mean.\n",
    "    Usage: The standard deviation provides a measure of variability by indicating the average distance of values from the \n",
    "        mean. It is widely used in statistics and research to assess the spread, dispersion, or variability of data around the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the values are closer to the mean, while a larger standard deviation indicates greater variability or spread of values."
